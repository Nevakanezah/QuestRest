You weep, languishing in the filthy gutter as the roiling bile trickles from your blackened lips.
"But Nev", you whimper, "Counting to five is hard!"

Fear not, poor wretch; for I have heard your pleas.

Introducing the QuestRest, a handy tool that replaces one small inconvenience for several others!

Designed and built in illegal sweatshops, the QuestRest holds all your quest-related cards when playing your games of Root: A Woodland game of might and right by Leder games!

A handy counter beside the quest deck shows you how many quests of each suit remain to be drawn,
sparing you the indignity of counting on your fingers like a crude ape!
Are you tired of fumbling the formerly-independent Quest and Completed quest trackers around in a feeble attempt at cleanliness? Well fumble no more! The QuestRest is a single solid object that doesn't comfortably fit alongside any other object in the game! Just try it, there's awkward empty space in every configuration!
But wait, there's more! The QuestRest also doesn't track how many quests you've completed in each suit, because you can mouse over them yourself, and have always been able to!

The QuestRest: The problems of tomorrow, today!

QuestRest concept provided by LilyG, to whom all blame can be assigned.

You can use my project outside of Root, but I don't know why you would.
